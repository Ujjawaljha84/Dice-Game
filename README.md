Dice Game with the help of Python programming


ðŸŽ² Dice Rolling Simulator (Python)
This project is a simple terminal-based dice rolling simulator written in Python. It allows users to simulate the roll of two six-sided dice by generating random numbers between 1 and 6 for each die. The program continuously prompts the user to roll the dice (y) or quit (n) using a while loop, and responds based on the userâ€™s input. It makes use of fundamental Python concepts such as loops, conditional statements, string formatting, and the random module to simulate randomness. If the user enters an invalid choice, the program provides a friendly error message and re-prompts. This project is ideal for Python beginners who want to get hands-on experience with user input, control flow, and basic logic building. It serves as a good stepping stone before moving on to more advanced projects involving GUIs or APIs. Simple, clean, and easy to understand â€” perfect for educational or practice purposes.
